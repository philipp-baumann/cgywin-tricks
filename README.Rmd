## Overview

[Cgywin](https://cygwin.com/) is aimed at bringing Unix tools to the Windows environment. This repo contains an opinionated set of recipes, and is particularly tailored to people suffering from Windows computers of measurement devices in laboratories.

## Updating packages

The Cgywin distribution ships only base packages by default. The executable `setup-x86.exe` provides updates and serves to install new packages. You can also access setup functionality via the Cgywin shell, for example:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Change to the directory where `setup-x86_64.exe` is located
setup-x86_64.exe -q -P wget -P gcc-g++ -P make -P diffutils -P libmpfr-devel -P libgmp-devel -P libmpc-devel
```

## Mounted drives

All system drives such as `C:` are mapped under `/cgydrive`, for example `C:` can be accessed via `/cgydrive/c`.
